To receive email notifications when an anomalous node is detected during the simulation, please ensure that your email address is added and up-to-date in the "admin_email.csv" file. The file should contain only one email address at a time. If you need to update an existing email address, simply replace the old email address with the new one in the file. Open the file in a text editor, locate the line containing the old email address, replace it with the new one, and save the file. If you don't have an email address in the file yet, add your email address in the following format: "name@example.com"
